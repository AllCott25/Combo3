# COMBO MEAL Security Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security updates implemented to address major vulnerabilities in the COMBO MEAL game.

## Top 3 Security Flaws Fixed

### 1. **Exposed Supabase Credentials (CRITICAL)**

**Issue**: The Supabase API keys were hardcoded in client-side JavaScript, allowing anyone to directly access your database.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Removed hardcoded credentials from `js/supabase.js`
- Created a configuration system that loads credentials from environment variables
- Added `js/config.example.js` as a template
- Added `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential commits

**Required Actions on Your End**:

1. **Create a config file**:
   ```bash
   cp js/config.example.js js/config.js
   ```

2. **Update js/config.js with your actual credentials**:
   ```javascript
   window.SUPABASE_URL = 'your-actual-supabase-url';
   window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-actual-anon-key';
   ```

3. **For production deployment**, use one of these methods:
   
   **Option A - Cloudflare Workers** (Recommended):
   - Store credentials as environment variables in Cloudflare
   - Create a worker that injects credentials into the HTML
   ```javascript
   // Example Cloudflare Worker
   addEventListener('fetch', event => {
     event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
   })
   
   async function handleRequest(request) {
     const response = await fetch(request)
     const html = await response.text()
     
     // Inject credentials
     const modifiedHtml = html.replace(
       '<script src="js/config.js"></script>',
       `<script>
         window.SUPABASE_URL = '${SUPABASE_URL}';
         window.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = '${SUPABASE_ANON_KEY}';
       </script>`
     )
     
     return new Response(modifiedHtml, {
       headers: response.headers
     })
   }
   ```

   **Option B - Build Process**:
   - Use a build tool like Webpack or Vite
   - Load credentials from environment variables during build

4. **Update Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Ensure your Supabase tables have proper RLS policies
   - The anon key should only allow operations permitted by RLS
   
   Example RLS policies to add in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Allow read access to recipes for everyone
   CREATE POLICY "Recipes are viewable by everyone" 
   ON recipes FOR SELECT 
   USING (true);
   
   -- Only allow authenticated admin users to modify recipes
   CREATE POLICY "Only admins can modify recipes" 
   ON recipes FOR ALL 
   USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
   ```

### 2. **Lack of Input Sanitization (HIGH)**

**Issue**: User inputs were not properly sanitized, potentially allowing XSS attacks.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Created `js/security-utils.js` with comprehensive sanitization functions
- Updated admin panel to use proper HTML escaping
- Added input validation for all user-submitted data

**Required Actions on Your End**:
- No immediate action required
- The security utilities are automatically loaded and used
- Consider reviewing any custom code you've added to ensure it uses the SecurityUtils

### 3. **Weak Admin Authentication (HIGH)**

**Issue**: Admin panel lacked proper role-based access control and session validation.

**Fix Implemented**:
- Created `js/admin-auth.js` with enhanced authentication
- Added role checking and session validation
- Implemented rate limiting for login attempts
- Added admin action logging

**Required Actions on Your End**:

1. **Set up admin roles in Supabase**:
   
   a. Create an admin_logs table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE admin_logs (
     id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     action TEXT NOT NULL,
     details JSONB,
     ip_address TEXT,
     timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   -- Add RLS policy
   ALTER TABLE admin_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   
   CREATE POLICY "Only admins can view logs" 
   ON admin_logs FOR SELECT 
   USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
   ```

   b. Create a function to verify admin access:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_admin_access(user_id UUID)
   RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
   BEGIN
     -- Check if user has admin role in user metadata
     RETURN EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM auth.users 
       WHERE id = user_id 
       AND (raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin' 
            OR raw_app_metadata->>'role' = 'admin')
     );
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
   ```

   c. Grant admin role to specific users:
   ```sql
   -- Update a user to have admin role
   UPDATE auth.users 
   SET raw_app_metadata = raw_app_metadata || '{"role": "admin"}'
   WHERE email = 'your-admin@email.com';
   ```

2. **Optional: Set up IP logging endpoint**:
   - If you want IP logging, create an edge function or API endpoint at `/api/user-ip`
   - This is optional; the system will work without it

3. **Update existing admin users**:
   - Ensure all admin users have the proper role set in Supabase
   - Remove admin access from any users who shouldn't have it

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Enable Supabase Security Features**:
   - Enable email confirmation for new users
   - Set up proper password policies
   - Enable MFA for admin accounts

2. **Set up Cloudflare Security**:
   - Enable DDoS protection
   - Set up rate limiting rules
   - Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

3. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Review admin logs regularly
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Keep dependencies updated

4. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Enable Supabase point-in-time recovery
   - Set up regular backups
   - Test restore procedures

## Testing the Security Updates

1. **Test credential injection**:
   ```bash
   # Check that credentials are not exposed in source
   curl https://yourdomain.com/js/supabase.js | grep -i "supabase"
   ```

2. **Test admin authentication**:
   - Try logging in with non-admin account
   - Verify session timeout works
   - Check rate limiting on failed attempts

3. **Test input sanitization**:
   - Try submitting `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in forms
   - Verify HTML entities are properly escaped

## Support

If you encounter any issues with these security updates:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all required Supabase functions and tables are created
3. Ensure your config.js file is properly set up
4. Check that Row Level Security policies are enabled

Remember: Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures.
