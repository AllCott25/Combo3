# Combo Autocomplete Debug Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Trigger Condition**
**Problem**: The autocomplete was starting when only the final combo ingredients were ready, not when all non-final-recipe combos were completed.

**Fix**: Modified `isOnlyFinalComboRemaining()` to check if all intermediate combos that are NOT part of the final recipe have been completed first.

### 2. **Animation Speed Too Fast**
**Problem**: The autocomplete sequence was moving too quickly (0.4 seconds delay).

**Fix**: Increased various timers:
- Initial wait: 12 → 45 frames (0.4s → 1.5s)
- State transitions: 0 → 20 frames (0s → 0.67s)
- Between combinations: 15 → 45 frames (0.5s → 1.5s)

### 3. **Poor Vessel Selection**
**Problem**: The auto combination was just taking the first two vessels without checking if they could be combined.

**Fix**: Added `findBestVesselPair()` function that intelligently selects which vessels to combine based on valid recipes.

## Additional Debug Steps

To help debug further issues, you can:

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   Add this to your browser console:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('debugCombos', 'true');
   ```

2. **Check Recipe Structure**:
   In the console, examine:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Intermediate combos:', intermediate_combinations);
   console.log('Final combo:', final_combination);
   console.log('Current vessels:', vessels.map(v => v.name || v.ingredients));
   ```

3. **Monitor Auto Combination State**:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Auto combo active:', autoFinalCombination);
   console.log('Auto combo state:', autoFinalCombinationState);
   console.log('Timer:', autoFinalCombinationTimer);
   ```

## Test Cases to Verify

1. **Simple Recipe**: Test with a recipe where all intermediate combos are used in the final dish
2. **Complex Recipe**: Test with a recipe that has intermediate combos NOT used in the final dish
3. **Timing**: Verify the animation feels natural and not rushed
4. **Vessel Selection**: Ensure the correct vessels are being combined in the right order

## Potential Remaining Issues

1. **Race Conditions**: There might be timing issues with animations overlapping
2. **Edge Cases**: Recipes with duplicate ingredients or complex hierarchies might behave unexpectedly
3. **Visual Feedback**: The user might not understand why autocomplete started

## Next Steps

If issues persist, please provide:
1. The specific recipe structure that's causing problems
2. Console logs showing the vessel states when autocomplete triggers
3. Any error messages in the console
4. A description of the expected vs actual behavior
