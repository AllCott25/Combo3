# Combo Logic Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the game logic to support flexible combination patterns where combos can be combined with other combos and/or ingredients to create new combos at any level of hierarchy.

## Key Changes

### 1. Unified Combination Logic in `combineVessels()`
- **Location**: `js/GameLogic.js`
- **Previous**: Used three separate cases (Case 1, 2, 3) for different combination types
- **New**: Unified logic that treats all combinations equally using recipe matching

#### Main improvements:
- Removed case-based logic that artificially separated combination types
- Created a unified `findMatchingRecipe()` function that checks if any set of items matches a recipe
- Created a unified `createVesselFromRecipe()` function to handle vessel creation
- Supports any combination of ingredients and combos as long as they match a recipe

### 2. Updated Auto-Combination Logic
- **Location**: `js/GameLogic.js` - `checkForParentCombinations()` function
- **Previous**: Only checked for parent-child relationships where ALL children must be present
- **New**: Checks all possible combinations of vessels (2 or 3 at a time) against all recipes

#### Main improvements:
- Now supports auto-combining any valid recipe match, not just parent-child relationships
- Can auto-combine 2 or 3 vessels at once
- Preserves the special final combination sequence (won't auto-combine the final recipe)

## How It Works

### Recipe Matching
The system now uses a simple recipe matching approach:
1. Extract all items from the vessels being combined (base ingredients + combo names)
2. Check if these items exactly match any recipe's requirements
3. If yes, create the new combo
4. If partial match, create a yellow vessel showing progress

### Example Combinations Now Supported:
- `Tomato + Basil → Tomato Sauce` (base ingredients to combo)
- `Tomato Sauce + Garlic → Special Sauce` (combo + ingredient to new combo) 
- `Tomato Sauce + Cheese Sauce → Pizza Sauce` (combo + combo to new combo)
- `Base + Sauce + Topping → Pizza` (multiple items to combo)

## Database Structure (No Changes Needed)
The existing Supabase structure already supports this with:
- `combinations` table with `parent_combo` field for hierarchical relationships
- `ingredients` table linking ingredients to combinations via `combo_id`
- The game now properly uses these relationships

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a recipe with nested combos in admin-tree
2. Test that combos can combine with other combos
3. Test that combos can combine with additional ingredients
4. Verify auto-combination works for complex recipes
5. Ensure the final combination animation sequence is preserved

## No Visual Changes
As requested, there are no visual distinctions for combos that can be further combined - all completed combos look the same regardless of whether they're final products or intermediate steps.
